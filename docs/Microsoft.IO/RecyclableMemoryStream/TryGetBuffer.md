# RecyclableMemoryStream.TryGetBuffer method

Returns an `ArraySegment` that wraps a single buffer containing the contents of the stream.

```csharp
public override bool TryGetBuffer(out ArraySegment<byte> buffer)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| buffer | An `ArraySegment` containing a reference to the underlying bytes. |

## Return Value

Always returns true.

## Remarks

[`GetBuffer`](GetBuffer.md) has no failure modes (it always returns something, even if it's an empty buffer), therefore this method always returns a valid `ArraySegment` to the same buffer returned by [`GetBuffer`](GetBuffer.md).
