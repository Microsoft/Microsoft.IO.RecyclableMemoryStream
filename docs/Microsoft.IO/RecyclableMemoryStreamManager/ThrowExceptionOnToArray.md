# RecyclableMemoryStreamManager.ThrowExceptionOnToArray property

Causes an exception to be thrown if ToArray is ever called.

```csharp
public bool ThrowExceptionOnToArray { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

Calling ToArray defeats the purpose of a pooled buffer. Use this property to discover code that is calling ToArray. If this is set and stream.ToArray() is called, a NotSupportedException will be thrown.
